# AnkiGen

This is a personal project for generating vocabulary flashcards in various languages.
Words are sourced from web history, and sample sentences are sourced from literature and Wiktionary.

Right now this is just an automated way for me to generate flashcards; this isn't intended for other people to use. It's designed for my workflow. Maybe I'll rewrite this to make it more usable.
